This repository consists of a dashboard that tracked my fitness journey from Feb-May 2023. 

I imported my cycling/movement data from Google Maps Timeline in JSON format, explained how it was parsed into Python and flattened 
it for use as a Pandas dataframe to be useful to extract insights. 


It contains a breakdown of:
- How much I spent on a weekly basis and what percentage of expenditure went to specific FMCG categories
- My daily caloric intake and how much of that was split between protein, fats and carbs
- My body weight tracked from Feb '23 to May '23
