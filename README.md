This repository consists of a dashboard that tracked my fitness journey from Feb-May 2023. 

I imported my cycling/movement data from Google Maps Timeline in JSON format obtained from the timeline above. I then thoroughly 
explained the process of parsing it into Python and flattening it for utilization as a Pandas dataframe, with further details 
provided in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.

Interestingly I biked on average 8 km per day, with a noteworthy observation of covering 11 km on average on Fridays!

The dashboard also contains a breakdown of:
- How much I spent on a weekly basis and what percentage of expenditure went to specific FMCG categories
- My daily caloric intake and how much of that was split between protein, fats and carbs
- My body weight tracked from Feb-May 2023
